My name is Andrew. If you want to know about me, visit my <a href="https://j.andrewcrain.com">website</a>. I write about programming (among other miscellaneous things) over there, and I stick to pure maths and computer science theory over here.

<h2 id="org840d82c">You have two blogs?</h2>

Not all programmers like maths, and not all mathematicians are programmers. This seems like a nice way to write about both without alienating anyone.

<h2 id="org475a2b5">Why is your website so plain?</h2>

<p>
Because I'm a (mostly back-end) software developer by trade. A minimal aesthetic is great for people like me who occasionally need to pretend to be front-end designers without actually doing a lot of designing. Plus, it really helps to keep the content at the forefront without any distractions. It's also a dream of mine to get a maths blog featured on one of those "Top 50 Minimalist Website" articles.
