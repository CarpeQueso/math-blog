<p>
For my thoughts on privacy in general, take a look at my <a href="https://j.andrewcrain.com/privacy/">privacy statement</a> on my other blog. In short, I hate modern analytics and tracking, and <b>I will never track you in any way</b>. This means that you actually have to <a href="https://www.carpequeso.com/contact/">contact me</a> if you want to give feedback. I won't be watching from behind the scenes.

<p>
This site uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>. The source code is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/CarpeQueso/math-blog">github</a>. The only extra javascript package I use is <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, but I serve a modified local copy (not from a CDN).

<p>
I reserve the right to advertise in the future, but if I do, it will be in a way that does not track you.
